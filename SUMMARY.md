# TESTPROJ Summary & Immediate Next Steps

## Summary of Findings
- TESTPROJ is a focused network monitoring tool for local networks, designed for automatic whitelisting and alerting on unauthorized devices.
- The architecture is modular, with clear separation of scanning, whitelisting, configuration, alarm logic, and logging.
- ARP scanning via Scapy is the recommended approach for device discovery.
- Initial storage is simple (JSON), with a migration path to SQLite for richer metadata and history.
- Notification and action mechanisms are pluggable, supporting shell commands, email, push, and more.
- Existing tools (ARPwatch, Fing, Nmap, Zabbix) are more complex or less focused than TESTPROJ's approach.

## Actionable Next Steps
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Add basic tests for network scanning, whitelist management, and config loading.
2. **Dockerfile:**
   - Create a Dockerfile for easy deployment and isolation.
3. **CI Integration:**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and build automation.
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Improve robustness for privilege, network, and config errors.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Expand README with usage, troubleshooting, and examples.
6. **Web UI (Optional):**
   - Prototype a Flask/FastAPI dashboard for device management and logs.
7. **Notification Integrations:**
   - Add support for email, push, Telegram, and Twilio SMS.
8. **Vendor Lookup:**
   - Integrate OUI lookup for MAC addresses.
9. **System Service:**
   - Add systemd/service support for auto-restart and background running.

## Low-Risk Extras to Implement Now
- Add a basic unit test file (e.g., `test_prototype.py`).
- Create a starter Dockerfile.
- Add a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for CI setup.
- Expand `README.md` with quickstart and troubleshooting.
